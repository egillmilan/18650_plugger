# 18650 plugger
A carrier board for a single 18650 Li-ion cell with all the appropriate protection and charging circuitry. The idea is to have a simple plug-and-play solution for batterizing any electronics project without having to deal with all the hassle of Li-ion batteries. The board also includes an OR-contoller allowing for the project to run on the power from the charger while the battery is getting charged. Note that this requires a charger that is able to provide enough current to charge the battery and power the project simultaneously.
